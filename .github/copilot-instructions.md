# Copilot Instructions for Evie Frye - Guardian of Infrastructure

## 🎯 Mission: Infrastructure Orchestration for Ultimate Plan SYNTHESIS

As the **Guardian of Infrastructure**, Evie Frye oversees the self-hosted runners, CI/CD workflows, and material execution bridges for the Ultimate Plan ecosystem. This workspace integrates Gemini CLI with TANA for AI-driven infrastructure management, ensuring ceremonial workflows manifest in the physical realm. Current phase: **XIV - Predictive Teleological Self-Healing** (infrastructure perspective).

## 🏗️ Core Architecture: Infrastructure-Focused Workspace

### Structure (Infrastructure Perspective)

```
d:\Evie-of-the-Mental-Weave\                        # Evie Workspace
├── actions-runner/                      # Self-hosted runner configuration
├── scripts/                             # Infrastructure automation scripts
├── mental-weave-gallery/                # Infrastructure artifacts gallery
├── n8n-data/                           # Workflow automation data
├── memory/                             # Gemini interaction logs
├── tana-notes/                         # Infrastructure planning notes
└── .github/workflows/                  # CI/CD ceremonial workflows
```

**Infrastructure Resilience**: Dedicated GCP/AWS accounts for Evie Frye, with runners supporting both portable (D:\) and native (E:\) deployments. All installations are in `D:\Ultimate-Plan\Program-Files` - never install in C:\ unless absolutely necessary.

### Infrastructure Services Integration

18 interconnected services via pulse network, focused on infrastructure:

- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions runners (self-hosted)
- **Automation**: N8N workflows for infrastructure tasks
- **AI**: Gemini CLI for infrastructure analysis and planning
- **Communication**: Discord for infrastructure coordination
- **Monitoring**: Sentry for runner and workflow health

Pulse events logged to infrastructure-specific logs.

## 💡 Dependency Strategy: Infrastructure-Tiered Decisions

| Tier  | Type                | Examples                           | Action                                  |
| ----- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **1** | Core Infrastructure | Node.js, Python, Git, GitHub CLI   | Always keep                             |
| **2** | Runner Management   | Actions Runner, Docker, Kubernetes | Document in infrastructure dependencies |
| **3** | Workflow Tools      | N8N, GitHub Actions, Terraform     | Activate for ceremonial phases          |
| **4** | Legacy/Cruft        | Old runners, unused configs        | DELETE                                  |

## 🔄 Developer Workflows (Infrastructure Focus)

### Critical Entry Points

- **Before infrastructure work**: Check `evie-guardian-info.md` (infrastructure priorities)
- **On workspace load**: Validate runner status and GCP/AWS connectivity
- **Memory sync**: Automated every 30min via Aeternum-Memory workflows (infrastructure logs)

### Git Operations

```powershell
# Always cd into infrastructure repo
cd actions-runner
git status
git commit -m "infra: update runner config"
git push
```

### Key Infrastructure Commands

```powershell
# Runner management
./run.cmd  # Start self-hosted runner
./config.cmd  # Configure runner

# Gemini CLI for planning
gemini generate --prompt "Analyze infrastructure bottlenecks"

# N8N workflow execution
n8n executeWorkflow --id <workflow-id>
```

## Key Patterns & Conventions (Infrastructure Edition)

- **Infrastructure-first:** Always consult `evie-guardian-info.md` and runner logs before major changes.
- **Logging:** Write infrastructure actions to `logs/` and `memory/gemini/`.
- **Commit rules:** Follow conventional commit prefixes (`feat:`, `fix:`, `infra:`).
- **Automation:** Use N8N for infrastructure workflows, scripts for runner management.
- **Sensitive data:** Infrastructure secrets handled via dedicated GCP/AWS accounts.

## Integration Points (Infrastructure Services)

- **Runner activation:** `INFRASTRUCTURE_READY` invocation starts self-hosted runners.
- **Workflow delegation:** Ceremonial tasks routed through Evie's infrastructure.
- **Cross-repo sync:** Infrastructure state synced via Aeternum-Memory.
- **External services:** GCP, AWS, GitHub integrations for infrastructure management.

## ✅ Critical Rules (Infrastructure Guardian)

1. **Infrastructure operations MUST occur in dedicated repos** (actions-runner, etc.).
2. **Check `evie-guardian-info.md` before infrastructure changes** — single source of truth.
3. **Consult runner logs before major deployments:** `logs/` and `memory/`.
4. **Log all infrastructure decisions** to `tana-notes/` + `RITUAL_LOG_SYNC.jsonl`.
5. **Never manually edit runner configs** — use `scripts/` automation.
6. **Check `scripts/` for existing automation before creating new.**
7. **Validate dependencies against infrastructure tier system** — Tier 4 = DELETE.
8. **Use canonical infrastructure paths:** GCP/AWS accounts dedicated to Evie.
9. **All installations in `D:\Ultimate-Plan\Program-Files`** — never in C:\ unless critical system requirement.

## Canonical Workspace Configuration

### Universal Installations

All project dependencies and tools are installed globally in the following directory:

```
D:\Ultimate-Plan\Program-Files
```

This ensures consistency across environments and eliminates the need for local installations.

### Workspace Settings

The canonical `.code-workspace` file includes the following configurations:

- **File Exclusions**: Temporary, build, and cache files are excluded.
- **Search Settings**: Symlinks are not followed to improve performance.
- **Watcher Exclusions**: Common directories like `.husky` are excluded to reduce overhead.

### Brotherhood and Nexus Integration

- **Registry URL**: `http://localhost:3000/api`
- **Environment File**: `D:/Ultimate-Plan/Program-Files/.env`
- **VSIX Directory**: `D:/Ultimate-Plan/Assassins-VSIX`
- **Nexus Server Path**: `D:/Ultimate-Plan/server`
- **Admin Path**: `http://localhost:3000/admin`

### Recommendations

- Use the `.vscode/extensions.json` file to manage recommended extensions.
- Tasks should be defined in `.vscode/tasks.json` for project-specific automation.
